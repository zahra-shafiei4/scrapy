Hello possible new colleague. You might be—or have the mind of—an architect, industrial designer, model maker or artist with technical fascinations and we'll be happy to hear from you. You might come from a creative/design background but don’t want to follow a traditional path in a traditional office. You might be 1-2 years (or more) out of school. Or you may be none of those but have the skills and the brain we’re looking for. If so, please read on…,
,
ABOUT US,
,
Nikolas Weinstein Studios is a professional studio of 10 people established twenty-five years ago, with a fabrication shop in San Francisco and a small design studio in Long Island City. The only separation is geography and the digital bond is strong. Combined, we are part machine shop, part engineering lab, and part giant kilns—all in the service of art. For the past twenty-five years we’ve been building sculptural installations for domestic and international clients. We're friendly, focused, smart, professional, and hard-working. We're direct in our communication; understanding that our main purpose is to contribute to the success of the studio. Because we're a small business, we all fill many roles. This means that there may be variety in what you'll be doing and also that you'll be expected to be part of a team, possibly working outside of your job description or comfort zone at times. ,
,
The LIC studio is where the artwork concepts are developed and this is primarily the aspect of the projects with which you’ll be assisting. The day-to-day work will be integral with developing the concepts for artworks; ideas, R&D, workflow, and technical stuff. But you will not be conceiving or designing the artworks independently. ,
,
THE JOB,
,
The position requires a well-rounded problem solver with excellent three-dimensional skills who is proficient and comfortable in a model shop or similar environment. You must be able to think and work independently and should have a technical, art, or craft background and a minimum of 1-2 years work experience. Much of the work that we do is not standard and requires problem solving on a constant basis. We often learn as we go and we solve new problems on each project. ,
,
— The job involves assisting the design director in setting up, processing, and outputting CAD related drawings and digitizing physical models.,
— This means importing new drawing sets from clients, setting scales, breaking them—out or simplifying the important components. ,
— Design and build simple architectural models using CNC routers.,
— Iterate small design studies and output info as requested by people in the shop. For example, small drawings of jigs or simple constructions with cut-lists based on sketches. ,
— Create internal construction documents to assist the fabrication team.,
— Assist with putting together presentations/short videos and proposals based upon editorial direction and content provided by your colleagues.,
— 3D printing & production prep - Manage the printing of parts and processing of drawings with engineering and parts fabrication vendors. ,
— Organize and maintain the digital library with occasional image corrections for visual resources.,
,
JOB REQUIREMENTS,
,
— CAD - Proficiency working in CAD, whether it be AutoCAD, Revit, Fusion 360, Rhino, or Solid Works. Basically, know your way around this kind of software package, the particulars are less important. ,
— Know your way around at least two of the following: Lightroom, Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Premier. Be comfortable in these programs and be able to do more than for example, touch up blemishes. Please send samples of your work with these programs.,
— Physical - Have some experience/interest in the built world. Exhibit some appreciation or understanding of physical dimensions and forces such that you can incorporate real-world conditions into your thought process and decision making.,
— General familiarity with woodworking and architectural model making.,
— Self-directed and independent thinking is a must. When given a loose directive of what’s to be done, you’ll need to analyze and define the problem, then plot your own course to meet expectations, while also keeping the team informed about what you’re doing.,
— Troubleshooter: if something goes wrong you will need to figure out what is causing it and fix it.,
— Ability to multitask: you may be pulled in many directions at once. This is a small business and the work is challenging. You should be comfortable with, or invigorated by, this prospect.,
— Hold oneself accountable for quality work.,
— Efficient, careful, and thorough. Calm under pressure.,
— Open to dialogue and accepting of disagreement. Many opinions and ideas are solicited. Not everyone can be right every time but we are all committed to the process and continue to contribute anew, each time.,
— Good written and verbal communication skills.,
— Basic administrative computer skills. Ability to compose an articulate e-mail is a plus.,
— Some domestic and international travel is required.,
— This is an in-person position.,
— Covid-19 vaccination is required.,
,
COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS,
This is a full-time salaried position with supplemented medical insurance, paid sick/flex time and 401k.,
,
LOCATION,
A drop-dead one-of-a-kind building that is a 10-minute walk to trains (7, E, F, G, M, Q) and has access to dedicated bike paths.,
,
APPLICATION,
,
To apply for this position, please submit: ,
— Resume and cover letter,
— Designs and/or drawings you’ve developed that show your ability to take apart or put together somewhat complicated things in virtual space.,
— Any information on projects you’ve been involved with that you think would assist us in evaluating your application.,
,
You MUST put ""CAD Design Assistant"" in your subject heading or you will not be considered.,
,
This job will remain open until we find the right person. Thanks for making it to the end. We look forward to hearing from you and perhaps meeting you.,
,
*We will contact applicants in the New Year.,
